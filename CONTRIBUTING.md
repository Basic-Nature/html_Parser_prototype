## Contributing to the Smart Elections Parser

We welcome contributions from developers, data analysts, civic technologists, and election transparency advocates! This project is designed to be scalable, readable, and resilient ‚Äî please read below for how to help contribute meaningfully.

---

### üß† What You Can Help With
- Add or update a **state handler** in `handlers/` for a state you know.
- Improve **format handlers** under `handlers/formats/` (CSV, JSON, PDF, HTML).
- Contribute **test URLs** for election sites in `urls.txt`.
- Expand **race/year detection** logic in `utils/html_scanner.py`.
- Optimize **CAPTCHA resilience** in `utils/captcha_tools.py`.
- Strengthen **modularity and UX** in `html_election_parser.py`.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Dev Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SmartElections/parser.git
   cd parser
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   # Then edit .env as needed for HEADLESS mode, CAPTCHA_TIMEOUT, etc.
   ```

---

### üß™ Running the Parser
```bash
python html_election_parser.py
```
You‚Äôll be prompted to select from `urls.txt`, then walk through format/state handler detection, CAPTCHA solving, and CSV extraction.

---

### üßº Code Standards
- Follow the format and logic in existing state and format handlers.
- Use `logging`, not just print statements.
- Prefer `Pathlib` over `os.path`.
- Include docstrings and inline comments.
- Test browser automation in both **headless** and **GUI** modes.

---

### üì¶ Folder Structure (Quick Glance)
- `handlers/`: State and format-specific scrapers.
- `utils/`: Shared browser, captcha, and format logic.
- `input/`: Input files like PDFs or JSONs.
- `output/`: Where CSVs go.
- `urls.txt`: List of URLs to cycle.
- `.env`: Controls mode, timeouts, etc.

---

### üß≠ How to Add a State Handler
```bash
# Add to handlers/<state>.py
# Must export a `parse(page, html_context)` method
```
Example:
```python
def parse(page, html_context):
    # Extract race, county, and CSV rows from the page
    return contest_title, headers, data, metadata
```
